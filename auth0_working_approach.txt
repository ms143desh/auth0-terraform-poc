Two approaches can be used for user creation:
	1. Create in Auth0 database and then store it in custom database. Using this we will not be able to store password in our database.
	2. Create in custom database and then create it in Auth0 database. Using this we will be able to store password in our database.

Approach 1: Create in Auth0 database and then store it in custom database.

Create Regular Web Application
	Allowed Callback URL's = http://localhost:3000/login/oauth2/code/auth0
	Allowed Logout URL's = http://localhost:3000
	
	issuer-uri = domain,
	client-id
	client-secret
Update security config and logout handler as per requirement
Update UI design as per requirement	

Create different flows for signup and signin
	Custom Pre registration flow
		This is required for email domain validations
		Either we can provide database connection and read records from database
		Or we can provide an API to have list of registered domains and then validate. Giving API seems more safe.
	Custom post registration flow
		This is required to save the user information in custom database. Two ways:
		1. Create API to take only user_id and then call the Auth0 management API to get all the details of user and then save it to custom database
			This depends on Auth0 Management API
		2. Create API to pass all the details of user and then save it to custom database.
	Custom login flow
		This is required to update the user information every time user login.
		Either pass the user_id or complete user information to store it in the database.


Approach 2: Create in custom database and then create it in Auth0 database.
This can be achieved with Auth0 Management API

Create Machine to Machine application
	Provide Auth0 Management API and required permissions, this is required for token generation
	
	issuer-uri = domain,
	client-id
	client-secret
	Use credentials to generate token
	Call specific Auth0 APIs for particular action - https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Users/get_users
	


Other options like custom database integration, rules
We can manage Resource server (API), Roles & permissions using Auth0 Management APIs
